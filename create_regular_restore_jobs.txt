Note:

The script appears to be part of a larger system involving database dumps and configurations based on server and schema information.
Some parts of the script, especially the comments with "THIS MUST BE ADJUSTED FOR FINAL CONFIGURATION," suggest that adjustments may be needed based on the specific configuration and requirements of the system.
Make sure that the variables, filenames, and paths are consistent with your system configuration before running the script.
