1.Row 1 Results shows about server up time from last reboot, currently logged in users and cpu load on server. 
The same output you can find using linux uptime command

a. current system time 
b. system up time
c. total no. of logged in users 
d. cpu average load in last 1, 5, 15 mins


2.Row 2 shows the number of process running on server and there state

a. total processes in active mode 
b. current running process
c. total process in sleep mode
d. total stopped process
e. zombie process

Zombie process or defunct process is a process that has completed execution but still has an entry in the process table. 
  This entry is still needed to allow the parent process to read its child’s exit status.

  
3.Row three shows the cpu utilization status on server, you can find here how much cpu is free and how much is utilizing by system.
a.% of cPU used by user process
b.% of cPU used by system process
c. by setting nice value
% CPU in idle state 
% CPU waiting for I/O
% CPU used by hardware intrupts
% CPU used by software intrupts
steal time

Steal time is the time that a virtual CPU waits for a real CPU while the hypervisor is servicing another virtual processor.


Row 4 # shows the memory utilization on server, you can find here how much memory is used, the same results you can find using free command.

total system memory 
current used memory by system
free memory
total memory in buffers


Row 5 shows the swap memory utilization on server, you can find here how much swap is being used, the same results you can find using free command

total swap memory in system
current used swap memory by system
free swap memory 
total cached memory by system


Row 6 

PID
User
PR - priority of running process
NI - nice value



PR - is the process’s actual priority, as seen by the Linux kernel.
RT - it basically means the process is running under real time scheduling priority.

NI is the nice value, which is a user-space concept, 

A modern computer operating system usually segregates virtual memory into kernel space and user space.

Kernel space is strictly reserved for running a privileged operating system kernel, kernel extensions, and most device drivers. In contrast, user space is the memory area where application software and some drivers execute.

*** Primarily, this separation serves to provide memory protection and hardware protection from malicious or errant software behaviour.

Nice value range (NI): -20 to 19

an interrupt is a signal to the processor emitted by hardware or software indicating an event that needs immediate attention. 
An interrupt alerts the processor to a high-priority condition requiring the interruption of the current code the processor is executing
